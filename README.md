# Introduction
In this article, we explore crime data in London for January 2020, providing valuable insights into crime patterns and types. This analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualizations to identify key trends and areas with high crime rates. The goal is to inform public safety strategies and provide residents with data-driven insights for their safety.

## Data Exploration and Cleaning
Initial Overview

The dataset contains 90,979 entries and 12 features. Initial inspection revealed several columns that do not contribute significantly to the analysis, which were subsequently dropped: "Crime ID", "Context", "Falls within", "Reported by", and "LSOA code".

## Data Summary

A detailed examination identified missing values and duplicates. Notably, "Longitude" and "Latitude" had less than 1% missing values, while the "Last outcome category" had 19% missing values. Missing geographical coordinates were dropped, and the "Last outcome category" was imputed with its mode.

## Data Type Reassignment and Column Renaming

The "Month" column was converted to datetime format and renamed to "Date". Additional columns "month" and "year" were created for more granular temporal analysis. The column "LSOA name" was renamed to "LSOA_name", "Crime type" to "Crime_type", and "Last outcome category" to "Last_outcome_category".

## Data Visualization
Geographical Distribution of Crimes
